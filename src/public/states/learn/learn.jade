        h2 About Bluebird
        p.
            Intended as a pocket toolkit, Bluebird is designed to quickly and quietly retrieve product information
            from either the Bluebird database or the public <strong><a href="http://developer.bestbuy.com" target="_new">Best Buy Developer APIs</a></strong>
            for use by store representatives and vendors without requiring client devices to reside on the Best Buy internal network.
            By relying on Best Buy's public APIs instead of the company's internal applications,
            Bluebird can function outside of the company's internal network, allowing employees to utilize their own devices to assist customers.

        p.
            Bluebird is an evolving application whose ongoing development is focused on delivering a performance-heavy, productivity-minded platform.
            The application is currently in early alpha, but is not expected to be ready for full-time use until its release version (1.0.0).
            Issues and feature requests can be submitted via
            <a href="http://github.com/SparksD2145/Bluebird/"><strong>Bluebird's private github repository</strong></a>.
            Bluebird is developed by the <a href="/#!/team"><strong>Bluebird team</strong></a>.

        h3 A Note on Availability
        p.
            When performing product lookups, Bluebird utilizes publicly-available data returned by the
            <strong><a href="http://developer.bestbuy.com" target="_new">Best Buy Developer APIs</a></strong>.
            This means information such as the quantity of a certain product within a given store is unavailable to us,
            allowing Bluebird to only provide an affirmative or negative "in inventory" result. Theoretically, if Bluebird resided within
            the internal Best Buy network, we could provide more in-depth data; however, as Bluebird is purposefully off the Best Buy
            internal network for use on Bring Your Own Devices.
