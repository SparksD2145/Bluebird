        p Intended as a pocket toolkit, Bluebird is designed to quickly and quietly retrieve product information from either the Bluebird database or the public <a href="http://developer.bestbuy.com">Best Buy Developer APIs</a> for use by store representatives and vendors without requiring client devices to reside on the Best Buy internal network.
            | By relying on Best Buy's public APIs instead of the company's internal applications, Bluebird can function outside of the company's internal network, allowing employees to utilize their own devices to assist customers.

                p I am a self-taught, eager software engineer with a passion for developing. As a previous Employee Toolkit developer,
                    | I am fluent with Best Buy systems and mehtodologies. I set out to create something needed at the retail level, a pocket reference that would
                    | keep customers engaged and employees on point. Bluebird is one of many contributions I have made to Best Buy, and I hope to make more contributions
                    | in the future.
