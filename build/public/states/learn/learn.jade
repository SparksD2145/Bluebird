                    Intended as a pocket toolkit, Bluebird is designed to quickly and quietly retrieve product information
                    from either the Bluebird database or the public <strong><a href="http://developer.bestbuy.com" target="_new">Best Buy Developer APIs</a></strong>
                    for use by store representatives and vendors without requiring client devices to reside on the Best Buy internal network.
                    By relying on Best Buy's public APIs instead of the company's internal applications,
                    Bluebird can function outside of the company's internal network, allowing employees to utilize their own devices to assist customers.

                                This tool primarily utilized by Geeksquad Autotech Agents is now unofficially available for use within Bluebird.
                                This feature's data is retrieved from Geek Squad Central.

                                <strong>Major speed improvements!</strong> Bluebird now utilizes the browser cache and compression to fuel faster finds!
                            li.
                                <strong>Updates!</strong> Now you can see when and how Bluebird updates. Nifty!
                            li.
                                <strong>RESTful API improvements!</strong> Bluebird's backend code is cleaner and more responsive than ever.
                                This means that future versions of Bluebird will be much more stable and client friendly.

        p.
            When performing product lookups, Bluebird utilizes publicly-available data returned by the
            <strong><a href="http://developer.bestbuy.com" target="_new">Best Buy Developer APIs</a></strong>.
            This means information such as the quantity of a certain product within a given store is unavailable to us,
            allowing Bluebird to only provide an affirmative or negative "in inventory" result. Theoretically, if Bluebird resided within
            the internal Best Buy network, we could provide more in-depth data; however, as Bluebird is purposefully off the Best Buy
            internal network for use on Bring Your Own Devices, this data simply cannot be retrieved.
